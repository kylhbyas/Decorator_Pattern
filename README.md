This is an implementation of the Decorator (Wrapper) structural design pattern.


# Program usage
How do we run your program?
* To run the program:
  * Open the program in visual studio and hit the play button
* Does it expect any inputs?
  * The program will prompt the user for two integer values.

# Notes
* What is working?
  * The program is believed to be working as intended.
* What are the limitations of the program?
  * Any values other than integers will throw an exception.
  
* What design decisions did you make?
  * Consistency was a prime design consideration.
